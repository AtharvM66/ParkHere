# Parking_spot_classifier
- Implemented a real-time image classifier to distinguish between empty and occupied parking spots.
- Utilized computer vision techniques to draw green boxes for empty spots and red boxes for occupied spots.
- Preprocessed images by resizing and flattening for efficient model input.
- Technology used: Python, OpenCV, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Skimage.
- Dataset: 6090 images (3045 empty, 30345 non empty).
